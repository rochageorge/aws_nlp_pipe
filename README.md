# AWS - Sentiment analysis MLOps pipeline

This project has the purpose of consolidating skills learned in the practical data science specialization, in which I will create an end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to model monitoring. The dataset [Women's Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) has been chosen as the main dataset.

P.s.: I will comment the code, later.

    1 - Fetch and clean the data (ingest_transform)
    2 - Bias fixing (bias_fix)
    3 - AutoML (autopilot)
